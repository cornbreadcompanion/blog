## Embed YouTube Videos
<div class="Video-wrapper">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/###?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Replace "###" with the ID of the video you want. It comes after the "v=" in a YouTube link and stops at the next symbol, usually a "&".

For example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0nFjLfR_VI&index=4&list=RDMlIsz18gvlw
The code you want is: V0nFjLfR_VI.

## Add a quote
<blockquote>Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full power and terror of these monsters. <cite>- Dustin Kensrue</cite></blockquote>

The "cite" tag is who the quote is originally from. If you don't want that, you can delete it:
<blockquote>Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full power and terror of these monsters.</blockquote>
