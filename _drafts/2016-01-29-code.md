## Embed YouTube Videos
<div class="Video-wrapper">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8DW0JaAocMI?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Replace "8DW0JaAocMI" with the ID of the video you want.

For instance, if you want to embed a video such as: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLzixKZp_a0
you should replace "8DW0JaAocMI" with "fLzixKZp_a0".

## Add a quote
<blockquote>Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full power and terror of these monsters. <cite>- Dustin Kensrue</cite></blockquote>

The "cite" tag is who the quote is originally from. If you don't want that, you can delete it:
<blockquote>Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full power and terror of these monsters.</blockquote>
