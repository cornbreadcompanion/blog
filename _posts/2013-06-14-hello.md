One or two trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston, containing people who had gone out for a day's boating and found the locks closed and a feeling of panic in the air.  A man in a blue and white blazer addressed my brother, full of strange tidings.

"There's hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and carts and things, with boxes of valuables and all that," he said.  "They come from Molesey and Weybridge and Walton, and they say there's been guns heard at Chertsey, heavy firing, and that mounted soldiers have told them to get off at once because the Martians are coming.  We heard guns firing at Hampton Court station, but we thought it was thunder.  What the dickens does it all mean?  The Martians can't get out of their pit, can they?"

My brother could not tell him!

Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to the clients of the underground railway, and that the Sunday excursionists began to return from all over the South-Western "lung"--Barnes, Wimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and so forth--at unnaturally early hours; but not a soul had anything more than vague hearsay to tell of.  Everyone connected with the terminus seemed ill-tempered.

About five o'clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely excited by the opening of the line of communication, which is almost invariably closed, between the South-Eastern and the South-Western stations, and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and carriages crammed with soldiers.  These were the guns that were brought up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston.  There was an exchange of pleasantries: "You'll get eaten!"  "We're the beast-tamers!" and so forth.  A little while after that a squad of police came into the station and began to clear the public off the platforms, and my brother went out into the street again.


### The Next Day

The church bells were ringing for evensong, and a squad of Salvation Army lassies came singing down Waterloo Road.  On the bridge a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came drifting down the stream in patches.  The sun was just setting, and the Clock Tower and the Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most peaceful skies it is possible to imagine, a sky of gold, barred with long transverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud.  There was talk of a floating body.  One of the men there, a reservist he said he was, told my brother he had seen the heliograph flickering in the west.

In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who had just been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and staring placards.  "Dreadful catastrophe!" they bawled one to the other down Wellington Street.  "Fighting at Weybridge!  Full description!  Repulse of the Martians! London in Danger!"  He had to give threepence for a copy of that paper.

Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full power and terror of these monsters.  He learned that they were not merely a handful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were minds swaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly and smite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand against them.

They were described as "vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundred feet high, capable of the speed of an express train, and able to shoot out a beam of intense heat."  Masked batteries, chiefly of field guns, had been planted in the country about Horsell Common, and especially between the Woking district and London.  Five of the machines had been seen moving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance, had been destroyed.  In the other cases the shells had missed, and the batteries had been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays.  Heavy losses of soldiers were mentioned, but the tone of the dispatch was optimistic.

The Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable.  They had retreated to their triangle of cylinders again, in the circle about Woking.  Signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon them from all sides.  Guns were in rapid transit from Windsor, Portsmouth, Aldershot, Woolwich--even from the north; among others, long wire-guns of ninety-five tons from Woolwich.  Altogether one hundred and sixteen were in position or being hastily placed, chiefly covering London.  Never before in England had there been such a vast or rapid concentration of military material.
