A lot of times, I find myself excited about and encouraged by song lyrics, artwork, or various random things. This blog is a platform for me to write about these encouraging tidbits and share what refreshes and strengthens my soul: art, music, and the gospel.

I live in Nashville with my husband and little one. During naptimes, I can be found working on something creative when Iâ€™m not overrun with laundry and dishes.
